#### Name Leo Garcia
#### Project Name: Five to Seven
#### Date: 1/10/2023
#### Description: An API that has three more controllers for three more functions, linked to different files. This time based on previous works.
#### Peer Reviewer: Avery Hillstrom
#### Review Notes: Very solid code that runs as intended in both swagger and postman! For Reverse It with Numbers and Odd or Even the user can only enter numerical values on swagger, otherwise it will not execute. In postman however, if a string value is entered the return will error out, so I recommend implementing TryParse to avoid any errors. Overall though very solid code that fulfills the given assignment very well!
#### Dev Notes: Applied changes according to peer review as best as possible
